# Piptube

Displaying YouTube in a small headless always on top window. Can be useful in Windows, where 'always on top' is missing from default window behaviors.

This is my first experiment with Electron.

Windows executable can be loaded from [this joking webpage I made](https://publicvoid.github.io/piptube/). The page also contains instructions on how to use the app.

To try it on other platforms (tested in Linux), clone the repo and run
`npm install`
`npm run start`
